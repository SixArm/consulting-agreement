Hereafter referred to as the "Effective Date".

### Purpose

Whereas, Consultant provides professional consulting services;

Whereas, Consultee wants to engage Consultant to provide professional consulting
services, on behalf of Consultee, and on the terms and conditions set forth
herein;

Now, therefore, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the mutual
covenants hereinafter set forth and other valuable considerations, the Parties
hereto agree as follows.

The validity, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed

laws provisions thereof.

The country courts and state courts located in the place shall have sole and
exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising under the terms of this
Agreement.

### Forum non conveniens

This Agreement includes the right of forum non conveniens.

Note: Forum non conveniens is a legal doctrine through which a court
acknowledges that another forum or court where the case might have been brought
is a more appropriate venue for a legal case, and transfers the case to such a
forum.

See: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Forum_non_conveniens

Example: Suppose the parties are both Delaware companies, yet the key people
involved all live in San Francisco. If something must go to court, both parties
may prefer to transfer the legal case from Delaware to San Francisco, to make it
more convenient for the key people involved.

## 2. Definitions

### Headings

The expresion "headings" in this Agreement shall mean the bigger bolder titles.
The headings are for reference purposes only. They shall not be used or relied upon in
the interpretation of this Agreement.

### Adjuncts

The "adjuncts" in this Agreement shall mean the paragraphs that start with
"See:", "Note:", and "Example:". The adjuncts are for reference purposes only.
They shall not be used or relied upon in the interpretation of this Agreement.

### Technology

The expression "Technology" shall mean designs, methods, processes, formulas,
algorithms, discoveries, inventions, technical information, drawings,
modifications, enhancements, improvements, and other technologies.

### Background Technology

The expression "Background Technology" shall mean all Technology that: (i) was
developed, conceived or owned by a Party prior to the Effective Date;
or (ii) is conceived or reduced to practice by a Party outside its
performance under this Agreement.

### Independent Technology

The expression "Independent Technology" shall mean all Technology that: (i) is
developed, conceived or reduced to practice by Consultant, at any time,
including during this Agreement, and (ii) where the technology is generic enough
that it may be useful for unrelated projects, practices, or purposes.

Independent Technology may be used during the course of the Work, and also 
may be among the deliverables.

Example: Independent Technologies include technologies such as 
open source code, or public packages, or demonstrations, or tutorials.  

Example: Consultant may (i) write a text parser that is generic and 
generally useful; or (ii) a testing tool that is suitable for becoming a 
shared library usable by multiple projects, or (iii) a data calculation 
application that can be published as open source code, or (iv) a system 
utility that can become a public package, or (v) a demonstration of how 
to use or implement an idea, or (vi) a tutorial that teaches a process.

### Ethics Wall

The expression "Ethics Wall" shall mean an information barrier protocol within
an organization designed to prevent exchange of information or communication
that could lead to conflicts of interest. 

See: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ethics_wall

Example: Consultant and Consultee may want to negotiate an ethics wall that
separates the Consultant-Consultee relationship from any other relationships,
such as from any other Consultant relationships. We suggest describing any
ethics wall within a separate Confidentiality Agreement ("CA").

Note: "Screen", or the verb "to screen", is the preferred term of the American
Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct. The ABA Model Rules define
screening as "the isolation of a lawyer from any participation in a matter
through the timely imposition of procedures within a firm that are reasonably
adequate under the circumstances to protect information that the isolated lawyer
is obligated to protect under these Rules or other law", and suitable "screening
procedures" have been approved where paralegals have moved from one law firm to
another and have worked on cases for their former employer which may conflict
with the interests of their current employer and the clients they represent.

### Prior Inventions

The expression "Prior Inventions" means all  ideas, inventions, or works that an
individual or entity created before entering into the Agreement.

Note: This expression is often used in employment or intellectual property
agreements. The purpose of acknowledging prior inventions in a legal contract is
to ensure that a party does not claim ownership of another party's prior
invention, either intentionally or accidentally.

### Include Without Limitation

The expressions "include", "included", "includes", "including" shall mean without limitation.

Example: The phrase "A shall include B" means "A shall include without limitation B".

### Gendered Names and Pronouns

The expressions of any names and pronouns shall include all gendered forms, such
as masculine forms, feminine forms, and gender-neutral forms. 

Example: the word "he" includes "she".

### Numbered Names and Pronouns

The expressions of any names and pronouns shall include all numbered forms, such
as singular forms, plural forms, and number-neutral forms. 

Example: the word "he" includes "they".

## 3. Documents

### Consulting Agreement

This document.

### Statement of Work

A separate Statement of Work ("SOW") may describe the Work, such as any plans,
deliverables, milestones, specifications, work breakdown structures, etc.

Note: We suggest using a Statement of Work for longer-range planning, or
larger-scope projects, or more-complex engagements.

Note: In practice, a Statement of Work may to refer to a higher-level Consulting
Agreement, General Consulting Agreement ("GSA"), Professional Services Agreement
("PSA"), or Master Services Agreement ("MSA").

### Work Order

A separate Work Order ("WO") may describe the Work, such as any plans,
deliverables, milestones, specifications, work breakdown structures, etc.

Note: We suggest using a Work Order for shorter-range planning, or 
smaller-scope projects, or less-complex engagements.

Note: In practice, a Work Order may refer to a higher-level Consulting
Agreement, General Consulting Agreement ("GSA"), Professional Services Agreement
("PSA"), Master Services Agreement ("MSA").

### Fees and Payments Agreement

A separate Fees And Payments Agreement ("FPA") may describe any fees and
payments, such as any estimates, retainers, rates, compensation, etc.

### Confidentiality Agreement

A separate Confidentiality Agreement ("CA") may describe any confidentiality
areas, such as for trade secrets, private security, non-public documents, etc.

Note: In general, a confidentiality agreement may be also known as a
non-disclosure agreement ("NDA"), confidential disclosure agreement ("CDA"),
proprietary information agreement ("PIA") or secrecy agreement ("SA").

### Non-Compete Agreement

The Parties have no non-compete agreement ("NCA").

Note: California law voids non-compete agreements for consulting and
professional services. This comes from California Business and Professions Code
Section 16600 which provides: "every contract by which anyone is restrained from
engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that
extent void." California law doesn't allow non-compete agreements for employees,
consultants, or contractors. The enumerated exceptions are for sale of a
business, partnership dissolution, and disassociation of a partner.

### 4. Work

### Priority

If there is any ambiguity, inconsistency or conflict between the terms and
conditions contained in any of the documents forming a part of this Agreement,
then the Agreement shall be construed in the following order of priority, i.e. 1
takes precedence over 2 and so on:

1. These terms and conditions.

2. The provisions of any Statement of Work.

3. The provisions of any Work Order.

4. The provisions of any schedules.

5. Any other documents incorporated or referenced herein.

### Work Order

All work performed by Consultant shall be documented in a Work Order ("WO"), and
signed by authorized representatives of both parties. 

### Work Order Acceptance

Consultant shall have the right to accept or decline any proposed Work Order. 

### Work Order Communications

All instructions, approvals, submissions, notices and any other communications
or transactions that must be made to Consultee shall be made through the
representative set forth on the Work Order. 

### Work Order Furnishing

Except, as expressly set forth in the Work Order, or Statement of Work, or in
this Agreement, Consultant shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment,
supervision and insurance need to perform the work.

## 5. Relationship

### Independence

The Consultee and Consultant are independent parties. 

There is no dependency, such as employer, principal of, partner of, or joint
venture.

### Independent Contractor

The Consultant is an independent contractor, and not an employee of Consultee.

Note: An independent contractor is A. free from the control and direction of the
hiring entity in the performance of the work, both under the contract for the
performance of the work and in fact; B. performing work that is outside the
usual course of the hiring entity’s business; C. customarily engaged in an
independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as
the work performed for the hiring entity.

The Consultant is solely responsible for all the Consultant's tax-related areas,
such as tax withholding, income tax, sales tax, or self-employment tax.

The Consultant is not eligible for any Consultee employee benefits, such as
employee stock purchasing, employee profit sharing, employee health insurance,
employee life insurance, employee disability insurance, employee retirement
plans, or employee welfare plans.

### Authority

The Consultee and Consultant have no authority to make any promise, guarantee,
warranty, or representation, or to assume, create, or incur any liability or
other obligation of any kind, either express or implied, against or in the name
of, or on behalf of, the other.

Note: For example suppose a vendor wants a legal confidentiality agreement, and
wants it to include the Consultee and Consultant. All parties must sign. No party
can sign for another party.

### Access

Consultee authorizes Consultant to access the Work's related aspects, such as any
content, technology, etc.

### Assignment

Unless otherwise specified in a Work Order, Consultant reserves the right to
assign subcontractors to the Work to ensure quality and on-time completion.

### Non-provider changes

Consultant is not responsible for any changes made by anyone other than consultant
or consultant's authorized agent(s).

Example of authorized agents: Consultee and Consultant may want to work with a
third-party who is fully qualified, such as an expert or vendor. The Parties may
mutually agree to authorize that third-party to make changes such that the
Consultant continues to be responsible for the changes. An area where this kind of
effect can come up in practice is with high performance systems such as
high-security servers or high-optimization databases, when Consultee and Consultant
want to get help from an expert or vendor, and want the resulting changes to
become part of the Work.

### Reservation of rights

All rights not expressly granted hereunder are reserved to Consultant.

This includes and is not limited to all rights in sketches, comps, demos,
prototypes, other preliminary materials, etc.

Moral rights, as described in the international Berne Convention for the
Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, are reserved to Consultant.

### Permissions and releases

Consultee agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Consultant against any and all
claims, costs, and expenses, including attorney's fees, due to materials
included in the Work at the request of Consultee for which no copyright permission
or previous release was requested or uses which exceed the uses allowed pursuant
to a permission or release.

### Referenceability

Consultee agrees to be generally available as a reference for Consultant.

### Displayability

Consultee agrees Consultant may display non-confidential results of Work in Consultant's portfolio.

### Copyright and license for the Work

Copyright for the Work is in Consultant's name unless otherwise specified.

License for the Work is in Consultant's name unless otherwise specified.

Upon completion of Work, and only upon receiving payment of balance due,
Consultant will sign a Release of Copyright that releases the copyright to Consultee.

Upon completion of Work, and only upon receiving payment of balance due,and
Consultant will grant Consultee a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide license to
use and modify the Work. 

Unless otherwise specified, this license does not include the right to
redistribute, resell, or relicense the Work, or the Background Technology, or
the Independent Technology.

###. Copyright and license for other technologies

While performing the Work, Consultant may from time to time work with Background
Technologies and/or Independent Technologies.

Example: Consultant may use or create open source software, demonstrations and/or
tutorials, stock photos and/or stock media, freely-available graphic diagrams,
published template documents, pre-packaged applications, commercial off the
shelf software, etc.

While performing the Work, Consultant may from time to time modify Background
Technologies and/or Independent Technologies, thus creating derivative works. 

Example: Consultant may modify open source code, edit stock photos, augment
graphic diagrams, fill in template documents, extend pre-packaged applications,
create plugins for commercial off the shelf software, create demonstrations or
tutorials, etc.

These modifications and/or derivative works may be used during the course of the
Work and may be among the deliverables.

Copyright for Background Technology remains the property of respective owners.

Copyright for Independent Technology is the property of Consultant.

License for Background Technology remains the property of respective owners. 

License for Independent Technology is the property of Consultant.

Note: Background Technology and Independent Technology may include many kinds of
copyrights and licenses. 

Example: open source software tool-kits may include the GNU Public License ("GPL"),
graphic diagrams may include the Creative Commons ("CC") license, template
documents may include the Apache License, etc. 

In all cases it is Consultee's responsibility to vet any and all legal aspects, to
Consultee's satisfaction. In all cases it is not Consultant's responsibility to vet
legal aspects.

Unless otherwise specified, Consultant's modifications of Background Technology,
and/or derivatives of Background Technology, belong to the Background Technology
respective owners. 

Example: Consultant may develop a software bug fix for Background Technology
source code, in which case the bug fix belongs to the Background Technology
respective owner, not the Consultee.

## 6. Limits

This Agreement can only be modified by a written amendment signed by the Party
against whom enforcement of such modification is sought.

### Change order

Any agreements not specified in this contract must be mutually authorized by a
written change order.

### Termination

Any Party may terminate this Agreement by giving 14 calendar days written notice
to the other of such termination. In the event that Work is postponed or
terminated at the request of Consultee, Consultant shall have the right to bill
pro rata for work completed through the date of that request, while reserving
all rights under this Agreement.

If additional payment is due, this shall be payable within 14 calendar days of
Consultee's written notification to stop work. In the event of termination,

Internet electronic commerce. Consultee agrees that Consultee is solely responsible
for complying with such laws, taxes, and tariffs, and will hold harmless,
protect, and defend consultant and its subcontractors from any claim, suit,
penalty, tax, or tariff arising from Consultee's exercise of Internet electronic
commerce.

## 7. Mutual Resolution

All aspects of this section are mutual i.e. apply equally to each Party.

### Agreement to resolve claims

If any controversy or claim arises out of or relating to this Agreement , or the
breach thereof, and cannot be settled through negotiation, then the Parties
agree to try in good faith to settle the dispute first by non-binding mediation,
and if that fails then second via non-binding arbitration, and if that fails
then via litigation or some other type of dispute resolution process.

Note: The purpose of this multi-step process is to save time and money for
everyone involved, and to try multiple ways to find solutions, without needing
to involve litigation. We're generally aware that some lawyers recommend binding
arbitration, yet in our experience the binding causes more problems than it solves.

### Non-Binding Mediation

If non-binding mediation is needed, then the Parties will use the American
Arbitration Association ("AAA") standard procedures for Non-Binding Mediation
Rules.

The Parties agree to do this before the Parties may initiate non-binding
arbitration, binding-arbitration, litigation, or some other type of dispute
resolution process.

### Non-Binding Arbitration

If non-binding arbitration is necessary, then the Parties agree to submit to
non-binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association
under its Non-Binding Arbitration Rules. 

The Parties agree to do this before the Parties may initiate binding
arbitration, litigation, or some other type of dispute resolution process.

### Recovery

In the event of non-binding mediation relating to this Agreement, the prevailing
Party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable mediators’s fees and expenses.

In the event of non-binding arbitration relating to this Agreement, the prevailing
Party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable arbitrator’s fees and expenses.

In the event of litigation relating to this Agreement, the prevailing Party
shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses.

### Integrity

If any provision of this Agreement, or restriction of this Agreement, is found
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unlawful, or unenforceable, or void,
such provision will be modified, rewritten or interpreted to include as much of
its nature and scope as will render it enforceable. If it cannot be so modified,
rewritten or interpreted to be enforceable in any respect, it will not be given
effect, and the remainder of the Agreement will be enforced as if such provision
was not included.

Any failure by a Party to enforce another Party’s strict performance of any
provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of its right to
subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement.

## 8. Mutual Alignment

All aspects of this section are mutual i.e. apply equally to each Party.

### Sole agreement

With respect to the subject matter hereof, this Agreement constitutes the entire

delivered by hand, deposited with a nationally recognized overnight carrier,
electronic-mail, or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage
prepaid, in each case, to the address of the other Party first indicated above
(or such other addressee as may be furnished by a Party in accordance with this
paragraph). All such notices or communications shall be deemed to have been
given and received (a) in the case of personal delivery or electronic-mail, on
the date of such delivery, (b) in the case of delivery by a nationally
recognized overnight carrier, on the third business day following dispatch and
(c) in the case of mailing, on the seventh business day following such mailing.

### Law Enforcement Reporting

Nothing in this Agreement is intended to interfere with, or restrain, or
prohibit law enforcement reporting. 

This includes but is not limited to the purpose of reporting a suspected
violation of the law to authorized law enforcement officers, or for the purpose
of a legally-mandated sealed filing in court or other authorized law enforcement
proceeding, or for the purpose of whistleblower provisions of government laws or

In the United States, law enforcement agencies include but are not limited to
police, the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ"), the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation ("FBI"), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), the
U.S. Congress, and any U.S. Government Inspector General.

When doing law enforcement reporting, a Party does not need the prior
authorization of any other Party, and a Party is not required to notify another
Party.

### Transfer

This Agreement is personal in nature, and no Party may directly or indirectly
assign or transfer it by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written
consent of all other Parties, whose consent will not be unreasonably withheld.
All obligations contained in this Agreement shall extend to and be binding upon
