that it may be useful for unrelated projects, practices, or purposes.

Independent Technology may be used during the course of the Work, and also 
may be among the deliverables.

Example: Independent Technologies include technologies such as 
open source code, or public packages, or demonstrations, or tutorials.

## 3. Documents


### 3.1. Consulting Agreement

This document.


### 3.2. Statement of Work

A separate Statement of Work ("SOW") may describe the Work, such as any plans,
deliverables, milestones, specifications, work breakdown structures, etc.

### 3.3. Work Order

A separate Work Order ("WO") may describe the Work, such as any plans,
deliverables, milestones, specifications, work breakdown structures, etc.

proprietary information agreement (PIA) or secrecy agreement (SA).


### 3.6. Non-Compete Agreement

The Parties have no non-compete agreement ("NCA").

Note: California law voids non-compete agreements for consulting and
professional services. This comes from California Business and Professions Code
Section 16600 which provides: "every contract by which anyone is restrained from
engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind is to that
extent void." California law doesn't allow non-compete agreements for employees,
consultants, or contractors. The enumerated exceptions are for sale of a
business, partnership dissolution, and disassociation of a partner.


## 4. Content


### 4.1 Independence

The Consultee and Consultant are independent parties. 

There is no dependency, such as employer, principal of, partner of, or joint
venture.


### 4.2 Independent Contractor

The Consultant is an independent contractor, and not an employee of Consultee.

Note: An independent contractor is A. free from the control and direction of the
hiring entity in the performance of the work, both under the contract for the
performance of the work and in fact; B. performing work that is outside the
usual course of the hiring entity’s business; C. customarily engaged in an
independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as
the work performed for the hiring entity.

The Consultant is solely responsible for all the Consultant's tax-related areas,
such as tax withholding, income tax, sales tax, or self-employment tax.

The Consultant is not eligible for any Consultee employee benefits, such as
employee stock purchasing, employee profit sharing, employee health insurance,
employee life insurance, employee disability insurance, employee retirement
plans, or employee welfare plans.


### 4.2 Authority

The Consultee and Consultant have no authority to make any promise, guarantee,
warranty, or representation, or to assume, create, or incur any liability or
other obligation of any kind, either express or implied, against or in the name
of, or on behalf of, the other.

Note: For example suppose a vendor wants a legal confidentiality agreement, and
wants it to include the Consultee and Consultant. Each party must sign; one party
cannot sign for the other party.


### 4.3 Access

Consultee authorizes Consultant to access the Work's related aspects, such as any
content, technology, etc.


### 4.4 Assignments

Unless otherwise specified in a Work Order, Consultant reserves the right to
assign subcontractors to the Work to ensure quality and on-time completion.


### 4.5 Non-provider changes

Consultant is not responsible for any changes made by anyone other than consultant
or consultant's authorized agent(s).

Example of authorized agents: Consultee and Consultant may want to work with a
third-party who is fully qualified, such as an expert or vendor. The Parties may
mutually agree to authorize that third-party to make changes such that the
Consultant continues to be responsible for the changes. An area where this kind of
effect can come up in practice is with high performance systems such as
high-security servers or high-optimization databases, when Consultee and Consultant
want to get help from an expert or vendor, and want the resulting changes to
become part of the Work.


### 4.6 Reservation of rights

All rights not expressly granted hereunder are reserved to Consultant.

This includes and is not limited to all rights in sketches, comps, demos,
prototypes, other preliminary materials, etc.

Moral rights, as described in the international Berne Convention for the
Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, are reserved to Consultant.


### 4.7 Permissions and releases

Consultee agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Consultant against any and all
claims, costs, and expenses, including attorney's fees, due to materials
included in the Work at the request of Consultee for which no copyright permission
or previous release was requested or uses which exceed the uses allowed pursuant
to a permission or release.


### 4.8 Referenceability

Consultee agrees to be generally available as a reference for Consultant, and that
Consultant may display non-confidential results of Work in Consultant's portfolio.


### 4.9 Copyright and license for the Work

Copyright for the Work is in Consultant's name unless otherwise specified.

License for the Work is in Consultant's name unless otherwise specified.

Upon completion of Work, and only upon receiving payment of balance due,
Consultant will sign a Release of Copyright that releases the copyright to Consultee.

Upon completion of Work, and only upon receiving payment of balance due,and
Consultant will grant Consultee a perpetual, irrovocable, worldwide license to use
and modify the Work. 

Unless otherwise specified, this license does not include the right to
redistribute, resell, or relicense the Work, or the Background Technology, or
the Independent Technology.


### 4.10 Copyright and license for Technology

While performing the Work, Consultant may from time to time work with Background
Technologies and/or Independent Technologies.

Example: Consultant may use or create open source software, demonstrations and/or
tutorials, stock photos and/or stock media, freely-available graphic diagrams,
published template documents, pre-packaged applications, commercial off the
shelf software, etc.

Consultant may from time to time modify these works, or create derivative works. 

Example: Consultant may modify open source code, edit stock photos, augment
graphic diagrams, fill in template documents, extend pre-packaged applications,
create plugins for commercial off the shelf software, create demonstrations or
tutorials, etc.

These modifications and/or derivative works may be used during the course of the
Work and may be among the deliverables.

Copyright for Background Technology remains the property of respective owners.

Copyright for Independent Technology is the property of Consultant.

License for Background Technology remains the property of respective owners. 

License for Independent Technology is the property of Consultant.

Note: Background Technology and Independent Technology may include many kinds of
copyrights and licenses. 

Example: open source software toolkits may include the GNU Public License (GPL),
graphic diagrams may include the Creative Commons (CC) icense, template
documents may include the Apache License, etc. 

In all cases it is Consultee's responsibility to vet any and all legal aspects, to
Consultee's satisfaction. In all cases it is not Consultant's responsibility to vet
legal aspects.

Unless otherwise specified, Consultant's modifications of Background Technology,
and/or derivatives of Background Technology, belong to the Background Technology
respective owners. 

Example: Consultant may develop a software bug fix for Background Technology
source code, in which case the bug fix belongs to the Background Technology
respective owner, not the Consultee.

If any controversy or claim arises out of or relating to this contract, or the

the American Arbitration Association under its mediation procedures before
resorting to arbitration, litigation or some other dispute resolution procedure.


### 5.3. Non-Binding Arbitration

If any controversy or claim arises out of or relating to this contract, or the
breach thereof, which cannot be settled by mediation as described above, then

such provision will be modified, rewritten or interpreted to include as much of
its nature and scope as will render it enforceable. If it cannot be so modified,
rewritten or interpreted to be enforceable in any respect, it will not be given
effect, and the remainder of the Agreement will be enforced as if such provision
was not included.

Any failure by either party to enforce the other party’s strict performance of
any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of its right to
subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement.
