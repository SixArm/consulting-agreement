## 3. Documents


### 3.1. Consulting Agreement

This document.


### 3.2. Statement of Work (SOW)

A separate Statement Of Work ("SOW") may describe the Work, such as
any plans, deliverables, milestones, specifications, etc.


### 3.3. Fees and Payments Agreement (FPA)

A separate Fees And Payments Agreement ("FPA") may describe any fees
and payments, such as any estimates, retainers, rates, compensation,
etc.


### 3.4. Confidentiality Agreement (CA)

A separate Confidentiality Agreement ("CA") may describe any
confidentiality agreement, such as for any trade secrets, private
security, etc.

Note: In general, a confidentiality agreement may be also known as a
non-disclosure agreement (NDA), confidential disclosure agreement
(CDA), proprietary information agreement (PIA) or secrecy agreement
(SA).


### 3.5. Non-Compete Agreement (NCA)

Consultant and Client have no non-compete agreement ("NCA").

Note: California law voids non-compete agreements for consulting. 
This comes from California Business and Professions Code Section 
16600 which provides: "every contract by which anyone is restrained 
from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of
any kind is to that extent void." It doesn't allow non-compete
agreements for employees, consultants, or contractors. The enumerated
exceptions are for sale of a business, partnership dissolution, and
disassociation of a partner.


## 4. Content


### 4.1 Independence

Client and Consultant are independent parties. There is no dependency
such as employer, principal or partner of, or joint venture.


### 4.2 Authority

Client and Consultant have no authority to make any promise, guarantee, 
warranty, or representation, or to assume, create, or incur any liability
or other obligation of any kind, either express or implied, against or in
the name of, or on behalf of, the other.

Note: For example suppose a vendor wants a legal confidentiality agreement,
and wants it to include the Client and Consultant. Each party must sign;
one party can't sign for the other.


### 4.3 Access

Client authorizes Consultant to access the Work's related aspects,
such as any content, technology, etc.


### 4.4 Assignments

Unless otherwise specified in the SOW, Consultant reserves the right
to assign subcontractors to the Work to ensure quality and on-time
completion.


### 4.5 Non-consultant changes

Consultant is not responsible for any changes made by anyone other
than consultant or consultant's authorized agent(s).

Note about authorized agent(s): For example, Client and Consultant may want to
work with a third-party who is fully qualified, such as an expert or vendor. The
Client and Consultant may choose to authorize that person to make changes such
that the Consultant continues to be responsible for the changes. An area where
this kind of effect can come up in practice is with high performance systems
such as high-security servers or high-optimization databases, when Client and
Consultant want to get help from an expert or vendor, and want the vendor's
changes to become part of the Work.


### 4.6 Reservation of rights

All rights not expressly granted hereunder are reserved to Consultant.

This includes and is not limited to all rights in sketches, comps,
demos, prototypes, other preliminary materials, etc.

Moral rights, as described in the international Berne Convention for

and all claims, costs, and expenses, including attorney's fees, due to
materials included in the Work at the request of Client for which no

right to redistribute, resell, or relicense the Work, or the
Background Technology, or the Independent Technology.


### 4.10 Copyright and license for Technology

While performing the Work, Consultant may from time to time work
with Background Technologies and/or Independent Technologies.

Example: Consultant may use or create open source software,
demonstrations and/or tutorials, stock photos and/or stock media,

pre-packaged applications, commercial off the shelf software, etc.

Consultant may from time to time modify these works, or create
